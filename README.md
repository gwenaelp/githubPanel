## About the development

Starting from a boilerplate angular app (angular-seed), I started creating the main view. I used bower and npm to manage external dependencies.

To make the development faster, I used frameworks and libraries (font-awesome, Material Design, angular-github-adapter).

This application was created in about 4 hours of time. I tried to focus on the delivery of a working prototype, without forgetting to use tools and best practices. I usually make tests, use linters, and use continuous integration, but as it was a really fast development, these tools were sadly put aside of the project at the moment.
